    "If you've gotten this far I hope that you are thinking that the Kalman filter's fearsome reputation is somewhat undeserved. Sure, I hand waved some equations away, but I hope implementation has been fairly straightforward for you. The underlying concept is quite straightforward - take two measurements, or a measurement and a prediction, and choose the output to be somewhere between the two. If you believe the measurement more your guess will be closer to the measurement, and if you believe the prediction is more accurate your guess will lie closer to it. That's not rocket science (little joke - it is exactly this math that got Apollo to the moon and back!). \n",

    "\n",
    "A *dynamic system* is a physical system whose state (position, temperature, etc) evolves over time. Calculus is the math of changing values, so we use differential equations to model dynamic systems. Some systems cannot be modeled with differential equations, but we will not encounter those in this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling dynamic systems is properly the topic of several college courses. To an extent there is no substitute for a few semesters of ordinary and partial differential equations followed by a graduate course in control system theory. If you are a hobbyist, or trying to solve one very specific filtering problem at work you probably do not have the time and/or inclination to devote a year or more to that education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, I can present enough of the theory to allow us to create the system equations for many different Kalman filters. My goal is to get you to the stage where you can read a publication and understand it well enough to implement the algorithms. The background math is deep, but in practice we end up using a few simple techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the longest section of pure math in this book. You will need to master everything in this section to understand the Extended Kalman filter (EKF), the most common nonlinear filter. I do cover more modern filters that do not require as much of this math. You can choose to skim now, and come back to this if you decide to learn the EKF.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to start by understanding the underlying equations and assumptions that the Kalman filter uses. We are trying to model real world phenomena, so what do we have to consider?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each physical system has a process. For example, a car traveling at a certain velocity goes so far in a fixed amount of time, and its velocity varies as a function of its acceleration. We describe that behavior with the well known Newtonian equations that we learned in high school.\n",

    "\n",
    "A typical automobile tracking problem would have you compute the distance traveled given a constant velocity or acceleration, as we did in previous chapters. But, of course we know this is not all that is happening. No car travels on a perfect road. There are bumps, wind drag, and hills that raise and lower the speed. The suspension is a mechanical system with friction and imperfect springs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfectly modeling a system is impossible except for the most trivial problems. We are forced to make a simplification. At any time $t$ we say that the true state (such as the position of our car) is the predicted value from the imperfect model plus some unknown *process noise*:\n",

It is merely a statement of fact - we can always describe the true value as the predicted value  plus the process noise. \"Noise\" does not imply random events. If we are tracking a thrown ball in the atmosphere, and our model assumes the ball is in a vacuum, then the effect of air drag is process noise in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section we will learn techniques to convert a set of higher order differential equations into a set of first-order differential equations.  After the conversion the model of the system without noise is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\dot{\\mathbf x} = \\mathbf{Ax}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf w$ may strike you as a poor choice for the name, but you will soon see that the Kalman filter assumes *white* noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to consider any inputs into the system. We assume an input $\\mathbf u$, and that there exists a linear model that defines how that input changes the system. For example, pressing the accelerator in your car makes it accelerate, and gravity causes balls to fall. Both are control inputs. We will need a matrix $\\mathbf B$ to convert $u$ into the effect on the system. We add that into our equation:\n",

    "In general the design of the $\\mathbf Q$ matrix is among the most difficult aspects of Kalman filter design. This is due to several factors. First, the math requires a good foundation in signal theory. Second, we are trying to model the noise in something for which we have little information. Consider trying to model the process noise for a thrown baseball. We can model it as a sphere moving through the air, but that leaves many unknown factors - ball rotation and spin decay, the coefficient of drag of a ball with stitches, the effects of wind and air density, and so on. We develop the equations for an exact mathematical solution for a given process model, but since the process model is incomplete the result for $\\mathbf Q$ will also be incomplete. This has a lot of ramifications for the behavior of the Kalman filter. If $\\mathbf Q$ is too small then the filter will be overconfident in its prediction model and will diverge from the actual solution. If $\\mathbf Q$ is too large than the filter will be unduly influenced by the noise in the measurements and perform sub-optimally. In practice we spend a lot of time running simulations and evaluating collected data to try to select an appropriate value for $\\mathbf Q$. But let's start by looking at the math.\n",

Therefore we must find the discrete representation for the noise term in the equation above. This depends on what assumptions we make about the behavior of the noise. We will consider two different models for the noise."

    "We've been exposed to several numerical techniques to solve linear differential equations. These include state-space methods, the Laplace transform, and van Loan's method. \n",
    "\n",
    "These work well for linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), but do not work well for nonlinear equations. For example, consider trying to predict the position of a rapidly turning car. Cars maneuver by turning the front wheels. This makes them pivot around their rear axle as it moves forward. Therefore the path will be continuously varying and a linear prediction will necessarily produce an incorrect value. If the change in the system is small enough relative to $\\Delta t$ this can often produce adequate results, but that will rarely be the case with the nonlinear Kalman filters we will be studying in subsequent chapters. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons we need to know how to numerically integrate ODEs. This can be a vast topic that requires several books. However, I will cover a few simple techniques which will work for a majority of the problems you encounter.\n"

    "We happen to know the exact answer is $y=e^t$ because we solved it earlier, but for an arbitrary ODE we will not know the exact solution. In general all we know is the derivative of the equation, which is equal to the slope. We also know the initial value: at $t=0$, $y=1$. If we know these two pieces of information we can predict the value at $y(t=1)$ using the slope at $t=0$ and the value of $y(0)$. I've plotted this below."

    "## Bayesian Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting in the Discrete Bayes chapter I used a Bayesian formulation for filtering. Suppose we are tracking an object. We define its *state* at a specific time as its position, velocity, and so on. For example, we might write the state at time $t$ as $\\mathbf x_t = \\begin{bmatrix}x_t &\\dot x_t \\end{bmatrix}^\\mathsf T$. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we take a measurement of the object we are measuring the state or part of it. Sensors are noisy, so the measurement is corrupted with noise. Clearly though, the measurement is determined by the state. That is, a change in state may change the measurement, but a change in measurement will not change the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In filtering our goal is to compute an optimal estimate for a set of states $\\mathbf x_{0:t}$ from time 0 to time $t$. If we knew $\\mathbf x_{0:t}$ then it would be trivial to compute a set of measurements $\\mathbf z_{0:t}$ corresponding to those states. However, we receive a set of measurements $\\mathbf z_{0:t}$, and want to compute the corresponding states $\\mathbf x_{0:t}$. This is called *statistical inversion* because we are trying to compute the input from the output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inversion is a difficult problem because there is typically no unique solution. For a given set of states $\\mathbf x_{0:t}$ there is only one possible set of measurements (plus noise), but for a given set of measurements there are many different sets of states that could have led to those measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall Bayes Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x \\mid z) = \\frac{P(z \\mid x)P(x)}{P(z)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(z \\mid x)$ is the *likelihood* of the measurement $z$, $P(x)$ is the *prior* based on our process model, and $P(z)$ is a normalization constant. $P(x \\mid z)$ is the *posterior*, or the distribution after incorporating the measurement $z$, also called the *evidence*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a *statistical inversion* as it goes from $P(z \\mid x)$ to $P(x \\mid z)$. The solution to our filtering problem can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\mathbf x_{0:t} \\mid \\mathbf z_{0:t}) = \\frac{P(\\mathbf z_{0:t} \\mid \\mathbf x_{0:t})P(\\mathbf x_{0:t})}{P(\\mathbf z_{0:t})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is all well and good until the next measurement $\\mathbf z_{t+1}$ comes in, at which point we need to recompute the entire expression for the range $0:t+1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice this is intractable because we are trying to compute the posterior distribution $P(\\mathbf x_{0:t} \\mid \\mathbf z_{0:t})$ for the state over the full range of time steps. But do we really care about the probability distribution at the third step (say) when we just received the tenth measurement? Not usually. So we relax our requirements and only compute the distributions for the current time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first simplification is we describe our process (e.g., the motion model for a moving object) as a *Markov chain*. That is, we say that the current state is solely dependent on the previous state and a transition probability $P(\\mathbf x_k \\mid \\mathbf x_{k-1})$, which is just the probability of going from the last state to the current one. We write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf x_k \\sim P(\\mathbf x_k \\mid \\mathbf x_{k-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice this is extremely reasonable, as many things have the *Markov property*. If you are driving in a parking lot, does your position in the next second depend on whether you pulled off the interstate or were creeping along on a dirt road one minute ago? No. Your position in the next second depends solely on your current position, speed, and control inputs, not on what happened a minute ago. Thus, cars have the Markov property, and we can make this simplification with no loss of precision or generality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next simplification we make is do define the *measurement model* as depending on the current state $\\mathbf x_k$ with the conditional probability of the measurement given the current state: $P(\\mathbf z_k \\mid \\mathbf x_k)$. We write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf z_k \\sim P(\\mathbf z_k \\mid \\mathbf x_k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a recurrence now, so we need an initial condition to terminate it. Therefore we say that the initial distribution is the probablity of the state $\\mathbf x_0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf x_0 \\sim P(\\mathbf x_0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These terms are plugged into Bayes equation. If we have the state $\\mathbf x_0$ and the first measurement we can estimate $P(\\mathbf x_1 | \\mathbf z_1)$. The motion model creates the prior $P(\\mathbf x_2 \\mid \\mathbf x_1)$. We feed this back into Bayes theorem to compute $P(\\mathbf x_2 | \\mathbf z_2)$. We continue this predictor-corrector algorithm, recursively computing the state and distribution at time $t$ based solely on the state and distribution at time $t-1$ and the measurement at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details of the mathematics for this computation varies based on the problem. The **Discrete Bayes** and **Univariate Kalman Filter** chapters gave two different formulations which you should have been able to reason through. The univariate Kalman filter assumes that for a scalar state both the noise and process are linear model are affected by zero-mean, uncorrelated Gaussian noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Multivariate Kalman filter makes the same assumption but for states and measurements that are vectors, not scalars. Dr. Kalman was able to prove that if these assumptions hold true then the Kalman filter is *optimal* in a least squares sense. Colloquially this means there is no way to derive more information from the noisy measurements. In the remainder of the book I will present filters that relax the constraints on linearity and Gaussian noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I go on, a few more words about statistical inversion. As Calvetti and Somersalo write in *Introduction to Bayesian Scientific Computing*, \"we adopt the Bayesian point of view: *randomness simply means lack of information*\"[3]. Our state parameterizes physical phenomena that we could in principle measure or compute: velocity, air drag, and so on. We lack enough information to compute or measure their value, so we opt to consider them as random variables. Strictly speaking they are not random, thus this is a subjective position. \n",
    "\n",
    "They devote a full chapter to this topic. I can spare a paragraph. Bayesian filters are possible because we ascribe statistical properties to unknown parameters. In the case of the Kalman filter we have closed-form solutions to find an optimal estimate. Other filters, such as the discrete Bayes filter or the particle filter which we cover in a later chapter, model the probability in a more ad-hoc, non-optimal manner. The power of our technique comes from treating lack of information as a random variable, describing that random variable as a probability distribution, and then using Bayes Theorem to solve the statistical inference problem."
